Since the COVID-19 pandemic's start, it has been difficult for people to identify reliable, trustworthy information about COVID-19. The creation of the CORD-19 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) has provided a comprehensive source of scholarly articles regarding COVID-19. We aim to provide a search engine prototype tool to help users parse through such articles. In effect, people can achieved higher scientific literacy and be better informed to affect change.
