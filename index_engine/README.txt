## Running the Search Engine

To run example query for "covid19" on index run python covid_index.py
Assuming that all_docs.txt and all_docs_orig.txt are in right path (data), this should create index

To run a user inputed query run python query_index.py
Then follow the prompts on the command line to enter your query
