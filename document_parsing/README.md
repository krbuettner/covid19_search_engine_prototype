# Document Parsing

For this, a collection of documents are needed. We create a ~10,000 doc subset and provide it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1e7anBSQcg-bNM0_7AIPfZIVNF7cEKWAH

We find that only 8,761 of these docs have specified URLs, so these are the only ones involved in search. 

You can make your own subset using sample_cord19.py and make docs_with_dates.txt, doc_surr.txt, and id_to_url.pkl (TODO) with DocParser.py.
